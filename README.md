Repeated offense will be a ban\n2. Come on, like don't raid, it's obvious\n3. No NSFW in any channel without a mute or ban. We may add a NSFW channel in the future so don't ask!\n4. Do not ban/mute evade, simple really\n5. Do not disrespect the staff, they are the higher beings, you must respect them\n6. No doxxing or ddosing please :D\n7. No advertising by any means [this includes dms!]\n8. Do not beg for roles\nThis seems like a lot of rules but its all just common sense. You have free speech!",
